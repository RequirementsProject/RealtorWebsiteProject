# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept
### a) Operational policies and constraints: 
The system has a limited amount of personnel operating and maintaining it. The project should follow ADA rules and regulations to meet user necessities. 
### b) Description of the proposed system: 
The system will have interconnected systems that will provide users with information about a product or information about other areas of operations.
### c) Modes of system operation: 
Modes of operations for the system include maintenance in case system breaks, and operational once system is completed. 
### d) User classes and other involved personnel: 
There are three overall user classes for this system. The first are operational users that will develop the system operations, data entry user that will focus on the systems data, and software maintainers that will maintain the system through it's life-cycle.
### e) Support environment: 
The support environment will consist of a single developer with no specific support software. The system will be distributed as a website with access to everyone. 

## 5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios
System operators will interact with the system by keeping it up to date with all the latest information, and by maintaining it throughout it's life-cycle. Users will interact with the system on a daily basis to search for information they need. 
# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
The system is to be acquired for free through the business operator.  

## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
